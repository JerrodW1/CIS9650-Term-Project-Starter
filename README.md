# CIS9650-Term-Project
Analysis of Healthcare in NYS 
This project analyzes primary care physician data across New York State in order to understand provider quality rating, patient satisfaction, and geographic trends in healthcare access. After the team has cleaned the dataset, we performed descriptive and visual analysis across specialties, ratings, review volumes, and ZIP codes. Our findings show that most physicians maintain high ratings, and convenient location across specialties. As healthcare consumers increasingly rely on online reviews to choose providers, understanding patterns in physician ratings, geographic trends, and specialty performance has practical value for both patients and healthcare administrators.

Our analysis focuses on three core questions:

How do physician ratings vary across specialties and geographic regions?
What is the relationship between the amount of reviews and physician rating?
Which cities or ZIP codes show the highest concentration of highly rated physicians?
By cleaning this data, we have generated descriptive statistics and visualized patterns across the state. These findings can help patients make better decisions and help medical facilities pinpoint locations where their services and accessibility can be further enhanced.

In addition, we examined the availability of services through remote video visits by analyzing the availability of telehealth services based on ZIP code location. We created additional columns, such as indicators of whether a provider offers telehealth services and a generated email address for contacting them, to provide us with a clearer view of our data and assist in recognizing trends and areas where additional support is needed in providing access to healthcare services.
